# Threat and Vulnerability Management
---
## 1.1 Explain the importance of threat data and intelligence


Intelligence Sources
- Open Source: ATT Security, Malware Information Sharing Project (MISP), Spamhaus
- Closed Source: IBM X-Force, Recorded Future, FireEye

Confidence Levels - How to rate your intelligence sources
- Relevant: Does the information directly relate to the threats of the organization?
- Accurate: Is the information valid and true? Is the information general or specific?
- Timely: Can the information be generated and distributed quickly?

Narrative Reports - big picture intelligence reporting
Data Feeds - specific threats

Indicator Management
Standardize threat indicators in order to facilitate sharing.
- CybOX
	- Describes observable security events
	- The schema that STIX uses
- STIX
	- JSON to standardize threat intelligence
	- 12 domains, current version is STIX 2.0
	- STIX 1.x uses XML, STIX 2.x uses JSON
- TAXII
	- Allows threat information to be communicated via HTTPS
	- Used with STIX
- OpenIOC
	- XML framework created by Mandiant (security team from Fireeye)


12 STIX Domains
1. Attack Pattern - describe ways that adversaries attempt to compromise targets
2. Campaign - A grouping of adversarial behaviors that describes a set of malicious activities or attacks (sometimes called waves) that occur over a period of time against a specific set of targets.
3. Course of Action - A recommendation from a producer of intelligence to a consumer on the actions that they might take in response to that intelligence.
4. Grouping - Explicitly asserts that the referenced STIX Objects have a shared context
5. Identity - Actual individuals, organizations, or groups (e.g., ACME, Inc.) as well as classes of individuals, organizations, systems or groups (e.g., the finance sector).
6. Indicator - Contains a pattern that can be used to detect suspicious or malicious cyber activity.
7. Infrastructure - describes any systems, software services and any associated physical or virtual resources intended to support some purpose
8. Intrusion Set - A grouped set of adversarial behaviors and resources with common properties that is believed to be orchestrated by a single organization.
9. Location - Represents a geographic location.
10. Malware - malicious code
11. Malware Analysis - metadata and results of a particular static or dynamic analysis performed on a malware instance or family
12. Note - Conveys informative text to provide further context and/or to provide additional analysis not contained in the STIX Objects
13. Marking Definition objects, or Language Content objects which the Note relates to.
14. Observed Data - information about cyber security related entities such as files, systems, and networks using the STIX Cyber-observable Objects (SCOs).
15. Opinion - An assessment of the correctness of the information in a STIX Object produced by a different entity.
16. Threat Actor - Actual individuals, groups, or organizations believed to be operating with malicious intent.
17. Tool - Legitimate software that can be used by threat actors to perform attacks.
18. Vulnerability - A mistake in software that can be directly used by a hacker to gain access to a system or network.

2 STIX Relationship Objects (SROs)
1. Relationship - Used to link together two SDOs or SCOs in order to describe how they are related to each other.
2. Sighting - Denotes the belief that something in CTI (e.g., an indicator, malware, tool, threat actor, etc.) was seen.

Threat Classification
- Known threats: you have information and are aware
- Unknown threats: no information and unaware
- Use controls and processes to deal with unknown threats
	- Examples of control types:
	- Detective administrative: job rotation
	- Detective physical: CCTV
	- Recovery logical: centralized data backups
	- Preventive administrative: security awareness training
	- Preventive logical: biometric
	- Preventive physical: mantraps
- Advanced persistent threat (APT): nation sponsored hackers
- Zero-day threat: threats that exploit an unknown security vulnerability

Threat Actors
- Nation-state: APT organizations funded by national government
- Hacktivist: black hats seeking political gain
- Organized crime: black hats seeking financial gain through methods such as ransomware attacks
- Insider threat: employees or trusted individuals within a company

Intelligence Cycle
- Requirements: determine needed information
- Collection: gather information to meet requirements
- Analysis: Process the data into a common format, then analyze it
- Dissemination: Share analyzed intelligence, provide reports to leadership
- Feedback: Gather feedback about the reports and identify improvements

Commodity Malware
- Malware that is written and then sold on the open(black) market.
- Can be part of a toolkit or sold as stand-alone tools.

		- system damage

Threat Research
- Reputational: looking at information (such as an IP address or domain name) to determine if there is a history of malicious behavior.
- Behavioral: examining the context of actions

Indicators of Compromise (IoC): forensic evidence or data that can help to identify an attack.
Examples of IOC:
- Unusual binary files
- Unexpected process or resource consumption
- Deviations in network traffic
- Unexplained log entries
- Unapproved configuration changes

Threat Management Focused Approaches:
- Asset Focus - asset inventory is the basis for analysis
- Threat Focus - identify how specific threats may affect each information system
- Service Focus - indentify the impact of various threats on a specific service

Categorizing attacks:
STRIDE model
- Spoofing
- Tampering
- Repudiation
- Information Disclosure
- Denial of Service
- Elevation of Privilege

Threat Modeling Methodologies
- Adversary capability
	- Acquired and augmented: common malware techniques or modified techniques
	- Developed: identify and exploit zero-day, but uses human and financial resources
	- Advanced: supply chains that have been exploited
	- Integrated: hardware exploits or non-cyber tools such as political or military resources
- Total attack surface: all attack vectors
	- Corporate network: ftp, vpn, wifi, access employees use
	- Website and cloud: front-end servers, APIs
	- Internal custom apps: forms, http, open ports
	- Cyber: social media, usb storage
	- Physical: gates, cameras, facilities
	- Human: social engineering
- Attack Vector: the points an attacker could enter the system
- Impact: low, medium, high, depending on a variety of factors
- Likelihood: the percentage that a vulnerability will be exploited

Threat Intelligence Sharing with Supported Functions

	- A security incident is a violation of computer security policy, acceptable use policy, or standard security practices.
- Vulnerability management
	- Seek to identify, prioritize, and remediate vulnerabilities before an attacker exploits them to undermine the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of enterprise information assets.
- Risk management
	- Identify risks
	- Determine the severity of each risk
	- Adopt one or more risk strategies to to address each risk
- Security engineering
	- The proces of incorporating security controls into an information system so that the controls become an integral part of the system's operational capabilities.
- Detection and monitoring: process security information, often using a SIEM
	- Privileged account usage
	- Privilege changes and grants
	- Account creation and modification
	- Employee termination and terminated account usage
	- Account life cycle management events
	- Separation-of-duty violations


## 1.3 Perform vulnerability management activities
Vulnerability Identification
- Asset criticality
- Active scanning: interacts with network systems directly to probe them for accessibility
- Passive scanning: gather information about networked systems without direct interaction.
- Mapping/Enumeration

Validation
True positive: reported and exists
False positive: reported and doesn't exist
False negative: not reported, exists
True negative: not reported, doesn't exist
Positive/Negative = reported/not reported
True/False = exists/not exist

Remediation Priority
- Vulnerability severity
- System criticality
- Information sensitivity
- Remediation difficulty
- System exposure

Remediation/Mitigation
- Configuration baseline
- Patching
- Hardening
- Compensating controls
- Risk acceptance
- Verification of mitigation

Remediation Workflow
1. Detection
2. Analysis
3. Remediation
4. Remediation Validation

Scanning parameters and criteria
- Scanning risks
- Vulnerability feed
- Scope
- Credentialed vs non-credentialed
- Server vs agent-based
- Internal vs external
- Special considerations

Inhibitors to remediation
- MOU
- SLA
- Organizational Governance
- Business process interruption
- Proprietary systems
- Legacy systems
- Degraded functionality

Dealing with inhibitors:
- Demonstrate that the vulnerability can be discovered with off the shelf tools
- Plan ahead to manage emergency changes
- Explain the consequences of the vulnerability, through business impact

Steps of implementing an information security vulnerability management process:
1. Identify requirements
	1. Corporate Policy
	2. Asset inventory
	3. Regulatory environment
2. Establish scanning frequency
	1. Constraints to scanning frequency:
	2. Regulatory and corporate requirements
	3. Organization's risk appetite
	4. Technical constraints (number of scanners, bandwidth, etc)
	5. Business constraints
	6. Licensing constraints
3. Configure the tools to perform the vulnerability scan.
4. Execute the vulnerability scan.
5. Generate reports.
6. Implement remediation.
7. Ongoing scanning and continuous monitoring.

A risk assessment matrix is created where subject experts grade all risk on their likelihood and their impact. This helps to prioritize the application of resources  to the most critical vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability scanning guidance:
- PCI DSS requires no results higher than 4.0 CVSS
- Check configuration management systems, log repositories, and other data sources
- Compare scan results with itself using trend analysis

## 1.5 Explain the threats and vulnerabilities associated with specialized technology
Mobile
IOT
Embedded
RTOS
SOC
FPGA
Physical Access Control
Building Automation Systems
Vehicles and Drones
- CAN bus
Workflow and process automation systems
Inustrial control systems
SCADA
- Modbus

A field programmable gate array (FPGA) is a type of controller that is not fully set at the manufacturer. The end user (or a hacker) can configure the programming logic, which can further exploit the network at a power plant, for example.

System-on-chip (SoC) is a design which provides all processors, controllers, and devices on a single processor die (or chip). These are often used for embedded systems.

The components of an ICS network are often described as an operational technology (OT) network, which uses a network application protocol called the Modbus. Modbus is a network application protocol that gives control servers and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) hosts the ability to query and change the configuration of each programmable logical controller (PLC).

A smart door lock may have embedded software, but they are not easy to reprogram or manipulate.

A real-time operating system (RTOS) is an embedded system that must have response times that are predictable to within microsecond tolerances. Therefore, they cannot tolerate reboots or crashes.

Embedded is a complete computer system that is designed to perform a specific, dedicated function. These systems are typically static environments. They are prone to having less support than dynamic computers like a desktop computer.


## 1.6 Explain the threats and vulnerabilties associated with operating in the cloud
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provisions IT resources such as servers and storage components. The client company ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of all virtual machines (or instances) and their operating system.

In an IaaS, the customer is also responsible for managing security of the applications within the instances created. This also applies in a Platform as a Service (PaaS) deployment models.

In an IaaS, the cloud service provider (CSP) is responsible for the physical hosts such as patching hypervisors and preventing insider attacks.

Cloud platforms are accessible via a web interface or web management portal. If an attacker exploits an unsecure form to perform a SQL injection, the CSP is at fault.

## 1.7 Implement controls to mitigate attacks and software vulnerabilities

Common Vulnerabilities:
- Server
	- Missing patches
	- Unsupported OS
	- Buffer Overflow (heap overflow, integer overflow, etc)
	- Privilege escalation
	- Insecure protocol
	- Debugging modes
- Endpoint
	- Missing patches
	- Outdated signatures for security tools
	- Mobile devices
	- Unapproved software
- Network
	- Encryption issues (SSL/TLS)
	- Outdated protocols
	- Insecure cipher suites (encryption algorithms)
	- Certificate issues (expired, self-signed, invalid)
	- DNS vulnerabilities
	- Interconnected networks
- Virtualization
	- Hypervisor patching
	- VM escape
	- Virtual network security controls
	- Access to virtualization management interfaces

Web Security Vulnerabilities:
OWASP Top 10 - The Open Web Application Security Project (owasp) maintains a list of common web security issues.
1. Injection flaws: insert unwanted transaction code
2. Broken authentication: flaws in authentication mechanisms
3. Sensitive data exposure: sensitive information is accidentally exposed
4. XML external entitities
5. Broken Access Control
6. Security misconfigurations
7. Cross-Site scripting (XSS): inserting malicious scripts on websites
8. Insecure deserialization: api exploitation
9. Using vulnerable components
10. Insufficient logging

A persistent (or stored) XSS attack aims to insert code into a back-end database used by the trusted site. For example, the attacker may submit a post to a bulletin board with a malicious script embedded in the message. When other users view the message, the malicious script is executed.

A document object model (DOM) XSS attack exploits vulnerability in client-side scripts. Such scripts often use the DOM to modify the content and layout of a web page.

A reflected XSS involves a trusted site, a client browsing the trusted site, and the attacker's site. It tricks a user in clicking a malicious link.

A non-persistent XSS is a reflected XSS.
