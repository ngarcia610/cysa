## 2.1 Given a scenario, apply security solutions for infrastructure management

Apply Security Solutions for infrastructure management
Identity and Access Management
- Mandatory access control (MAC): prescribes that resources are classified by sensitivity and access is granted based in a sensitivity level assigned to users. It does not allow for user-controlled access.
- Discretionary access control (DAC): user is allowed to control access to a resource that he creates or owns.
- Role-based access control (RBAC): users have assigned roles, and along with those roles come a preconfigured set of rights and permissions.
- Network access control (NAC): systems can make remote access decisions based on a combination of factors.

Mandatory access control (MAC) provides the highest level of security. It bases access control on security labels, security clearance levels, and role classification. Each resource and user can be labeled as belonging to a specific domain (compartmentalized). A user may only access a resource if they belong to the same domain. In the MAC model, if the model used is hierarchical, subjects are only permitted to access objects at their own clearance level, or below. A Non-discretionary access control model does not give users discretion regarding the groups of objects they are allowed to access, and are unable to transfer objects to other subjects. In MAC models, labels are used to define clearance levels.

Discretionary Access Control (DAC) controls access based on the requestor, and on access rules stating what requestors are or are not allowed to do. This control model is more flexible, but less secure than MAC. stresses the importance of the owner, and utilizes access control lists (ACL)

Role-based access control (RBAC) assigns permissions based on a user's role within the organization. RBAC provides moderate security, but is not as secure as MAC.

Attribute-based access (ABAC) gives very fine-grained access control options, capable of making access decisions based on a wide variety of subject and object attributes. This control model is the most complex model.

Cloud access security broker (CASB)
- An on-premises or cloud-based security policy enforcement point that is placed between cloud service consumers and cloud service providers to combine and interject enterprise security policies as cloud-based resources are accessed.
- Think of the CASB as the sheriff that enforces the laws set by the cloud service administrators.
- A CASB provides a suite of security functions that work across platforms and cloud providers, but are all managed from a single access point and is cost effective, secure, and offers AI integration.

FaaS
- Serverless is a modern design pattern for service delivery. 
- Billing is based on execution time, rather than hourly charges. 

Virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) refers to using a virtual machine as a means of provisioning corporate desktops. When a VDI client machine starts, it boots a minimal OS, allowing the user to log on to a VM stored on the company server infrastructure.

Containerization is a type of virtualization that enforces resource separation at the operating system level. The OS defines isolated "cells" for each user instance to run in.

Isolation:
Sheep dip - an isolated computer
Air gap - isolated systems

## 2.2 Explain software assurance best practices

A formal method is a means of verifying a complex system, and uses a mathematical model of the inputs and outputs of a system to prove that the system works as specified in all cases.

Dynamic analysis is performed by executing the compiled program. Analysis tools are used to inspect the way the process executes and interacts with the host platform and network.

Static code analysis is performed against the application code before it is compiled into an executable process.

Security assertions markup language (SAML) information is communicated in the form of assertions. Authentication assertions contain information about acts of authentication or user identity validation, attribute assertions containing information about users, and authorization assertions containing information about each user's level of access.

REST is a loosely specified framework that allows the service provider more choice over implementation elements.

SOAP provides a structure for transmitting and receiving information used in web applications to a variety of device types using an application programming interface (API). SOAP is a heavily specified protocol, with many implementation requirements.

Microservices is a design paradigm applied to application development. Microservice architecture uses self-contained service modules, each performing a single function with clearly defined inputs and output and applies them to the design of a network application, such as an order processing system, video streaming service, or email system.

The software development life cycle (SDLC) is the division of programming projects into separate phases.

An interactive debugger is the principal means of performing dynamic analysis. A debugger provides the ability to pause execution, and to monitor and adjust the value of variables at different stages.

A stress test consists of a battery of tests that are designed to evaluate how an app performs under extreme processing load.

Fuzzing is a technique designed to test software for bugs and vulnerabilities. A poorly secured app will likely crash during fuzzing.

Session management is a fundamental security component in the majority of web applications. Session management is particularly important when it comes to user authentication, as it is required to ensure the integrity of the user and the data generated by the user while interacting with the web application.

An authentication mechanism specifies a challenge-response protocol in which data is exchanged between the client and the server for the purposes of authentication and establishment of a security layer to execute communication.

Cookie poisoning modifies the contents of a cookie after it has been generated and sent by the web service to the client's browser.

Clickjacking is a spoofing-type attack designed to trick a client into clicking a web page link that is different from where they had intended to go.

An attacker might use a canonicalization attack to disguise the nature of the malicious input.

The Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
1. Planning
2. Requirements
3. Design
4. Implementation (Development)
5. Testing
6. Deployment
7. Maintenance
8. End of Life

Software Development Models:
- Code and Fix
- Waterfall
- Agile
- Iterative
- Spiral: good for budget constraints, medium to high risk projects, long-term commitment

## 2.3 Explain hardware assurance best practices

Processor security extensions are low-level CPU instructions that enable secure processing include technologies such as Secure Memory Encryption (SME) and Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV),Trusted Execution Technology (TXT) and Software Guard Extensions (SGX). They ensure sensitive data stored in memory is only accessible by an authorized process.

In a computer device, the RoT is usually established by a type of cryptoprocessor called a trusted platform module (TPM). TPM is a specification for hardware-based storage of digital certificates, cryptographic keys, hashed passwords, and other user and platform identification information.

Self-encrypting drives (SED) reduce the performance impact of cryptographic security by performing the encryption on the drive controller.

Modern computing devices use a different kind of firmware called unified extensible firmware interface (UEFI).

The US Department of Defense (DoD) has set up a Trusted Foundry Program, operated by the Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA). Accredited suppliers have proved themselves capable of operating a secure supply chain, from design through to manufacture and testing.

Self-encrypting drives (SED) reduce the performance impact of cryptographic security by performing the encryption on the drive controller.

Measured boot is the capability to transmit an attestation report containing a boot log to an external server, such as a network access control server.

To create a secure enclave, the software developer must obtain a key from the CPU vendor to use to identify the trusted process. A typical use for the application is to use a secure enclave to store encryption keys.

Measured boot is the capability to transmit an attestation report containing a boot log to an external server, such as a network access control server.

Intel Boot Guard uses special keys and configuration settings to validate attempted firmware updates.

Certain operations, such as to initialize a memory location, should only be performed once or not at all (atomic). A secure enclave is intended to ensure that malicious code does not try to re-use or hijack an atomic execution operation.

Bus encryption ensures the device at the end of the bus is trusted to decrypt the data when the data is transferred to another device over a bus, such as PCIe, USB, or HDMI.
