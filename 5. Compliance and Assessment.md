# Compliance and Assessment
---
## 5.1 Understand the importance of data privacy and protection.

PII - personally identifiable information; records that may be associated with a specific individual
PHI - protected health information; health records about an individual patient

GAPP - Generally Accepted Privacy Principles; 10 Components:
1. Management - Organizations handling private information should have policies, procedures, and governance structures in place to protect privacy
2. Notice - Data subjects should receive notice that their information is being collected and used, as well as access to the privacy policies and procedures followed by the organization.
3. Choice and Consent - The organization should inform data subjects of their options regarding the data they own and get consent from those individuals for the collection, storage, use, and sharing of that information.
4. Collection - The organization should only collect personal information for purposes disclosed in its privacy notices.
5. Use, retention, and disposal - organizations should only collect and use personal information for disclosed purposes, and they should dispose of the data securely as soon as it is no longer needed for the disclosed purpose.
6. Access - organizations should provide data subjects with the ability to review and update their personal information.
7. Disclosure to third parties - organizations should only share information with third parties if that sharing is consistent with the purposes disclosed in privacy notices, and they have the consent of the individual to share that information.
8. Security - the organization must secure private information against unauthorized access, either physically or logically.
9. Quality - the org should take reasonable steps to ensure that the private information it maintains is accurate, complete, and relevant.
10. Monitoring and enforcement - the organization should have a program in place to monitor compliance with its privacy policies and provide a dispute resolution mechanism.

Compliance
HIPAA - covers providers, insurers, information clearinghouses
FERPA - covers student educational records
GLBA - covers financial services
FISMA - federal organizations are required to adopt information assurance controls
COSO - guidance on fraud, controls, finance, and ethics
SOX - storage and retention of documents relating to an organization's financial and business operations.

Social digital rights management (DRM) is a solution applied to protect content from being shared. This involves encoding a watermark into the media file. If the file is posted to a file sharing site, search tools can track the media file and the company can enforce appropriate action.

DRM solutions can also restrict the distributing of unauthorized copies by authorizing specific hardware players. However, the media player can still be shared with others.

Restrictions can be placed to authorized viewing applications like a specific video player. However, sharing can still occur with the right video player.

A data loss prevention (DLP) solution is appropriate within the company. DLP is not possible with other companies unless they are integrated in some way.

Data minimization is the principle that data should only be processed and stored if it is necessary to perform the purpose for which it is collected. It affects the data retention policy.


## 5.2 Given a scenario, apply security concepts in support of organizational risk mitigation.

Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) standards, the assessor requires documentation to show that the compensating control is deployed as part of the process and is monitored for effectiveness.

A risk register is a comprehensible format of risk assessments. The register may resemble the traffic light grid with columns for impact and likelihood ratings, date of identification, description, etc.

A systems assessment is the process of identifying which system is most critical. This information will help in designing a risk assessment process.

Hardware source authenticity is understanding and knowing that a purchased product is from reputable suppliers, and not from second-hand or aftermarket sources, where the risk is greater for counterfeited or compromised devices.

The formula for annual loss expectancy (ALE) = SLE (Single Loss Expectancy) x ARO (Annual Rate of Occurrence). Management predicts these costly incidents will happen once a month next year, or in other words, 12 times next year.

The risk frame sets an overall goal for the degree of risk that can be tolerated and demarcates responsibilities. The risk frame directs and receives inputs from all other processes.

An assessment identifies and prioritizes business processes or workflows. A systems assessment determines which IT assets and procedures support these workflows. Risk identification takes place within the assess component.

Responding to risk involves mitigating risk factors by deploying managerial, operational, and technical security controls.

Risks should be carefully monitored for changes by evaluating the effectiveness of risk response measures and identify changes that could affect risk management processes.

Return on security investment (ROSI) includes multiple factors such as the cost of the solution, and the reduction of the annual loss expectancy (ALE). ALE can depend a little on operational costs due to an incident happening or not, or even how quickly it is resolved.

Asset value (AV) is the direct cost (monetary) of a product or solution. When calculating quantitative risk, the asset value represents the magnitude of the risk.

Exposure factor (EF) is how often a risk will occur. This is the probability represented in a quantitative risk calculation.

Single loss expectancy (SLE) is the product of an AV and EF. This is the quantitative risk result.


## 5.3 Explain the importance of frameworks, policies, procedures, and controls.

Code of conduct - outlines user and administrator expectations
Password policy - best practices for creating and maintaining passwords
Acceptable use policy - describes how someone can use a service or resource
Audit policy - tracks account log-on, management events, object access, and changes to system security and integrity

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework is risk-based and includes:
Framework core
1. Identify: risk assessment, asset management, governance, business environment, and risk management strategy
2. Protect: information processes and procedures, access control, awareness and training, data security, maintenance, and protective technology.
3. Detect: anomolies and events, security continuous monitoring, detection processes.
4. Respond: response planning, communications, analysis, mitigation, improvements
5. Recover: recovery planning, improvements, communications

Implementation tiers - assess how closely core functions are integrated with the organization's overall risk management process

Framework profiles - supply statements of current cybersecurity outcomes and target cybersecurity outcomes

Prescriptive Framework:
Tier 1 - represents an organization that has a reactive approach to security. This means something bad happens and they scramble to fix it.
Tier 2 - represents an organization that prepares to mitigate cybersecurity risks by performing risk assessments.
Tier 3 - represents an organization with defined policies and procedures driven by the IT department.
Tier 4 - represents an organization that demonstrates management oversight of risks. They have risk-driven business policies and processes, and procedures for optimizing and continuously monitoring controls.

Operational Security Controls = Training, Security Guards

RTO - the shortest time period after a disaster within which a resource must be restored to avoid unacceptable consequences. RTO accepts downtime exists and is smaller 
RPO - the point in time to which the disrupted resource must be returned
MTD - maximum tolerable downtime
WRT - work recovery time; the difference between RTO and MTD
MTBF - mean time between failures; the estimated time a device will operate before failure occurs
