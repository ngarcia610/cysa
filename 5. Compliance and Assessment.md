# Compliance and Assessment
---
## 5.1 Understand the importance of data privacy and protection.

PII
- Personally identifiable information
- Records that may be associated with a specific individual
- Credit reports, tax reports

PHI
- Protected health information
- Health records about an individual patient
- Regulated by HIPAA

GAPP - Generally Accepted Privacy Principles; 10 Components:
1. Management - Organizations handling private information should have policies, procedures, and governance structures in place to protect privacy
2. Notice - Data subjects should receive notice that their information is being collected and used, as well as access to the privacy policies and procedures followed by the organization.
3. Choice and Consent - The organization should inform data subjects of their options regarding the data they own and get consent from those individuals for the collection, storage, use, and sharing of that information.
4. Collection - The organization should only collect personal information for purposes disclosed in its privacy notices.
5. Use, retention, and disposal - organizations should only collect and use personal information for disclosed purposes, and they should dispose of the data securely as soon as it is no longer needed for the disclosed purpose.
6. Access - organizations should provide data subjects with the ability to review and update their personal information.
7. Disclosure to third parties - organizations should only share information with third parties if that sharing is consistent with the purposes disclosed in privacy notices, and they have the consent of the individual to share that information.
8. Security - the organization must secure private information against unauthorized access, either physically or logically.
9. Quality - the org should take reasonable steps to ensure that the private information it maintains is accurate, complete, and relevant.
10. Monitoring and enforcement - the organization should have a program in place to monitor compliance with its privacy policies and provide a dispute resolution mechanism.

Limiting data collection
- Notice and consent is the first level of restriction on data collection
- Never collect information outside of disclosures
- Minimize information collected
- Delete unneeded information quickly
- Legal teams should be consulted before data collection
- Verify 3rd party privacy practices

Privacy Assessments
- PTA
	- Privacy threshold analysis
	- Evaluates the use of personal information to determine whether privacy controls are necessary
- PIA
	- Privacy impact assessment
	- Evaluates the privacy controls used by an IT system to determine whether they are sufficient
	- Department of Homeland Security has a template
	- Three goals:
		1. Ensures that PII handling meets all applicable requirements
		2. Identifies risks associated with handling PII within an IT system
		3. Examines privacy controls and recommends mitigations
	- PIA Questions:
		- What information is being collected?
		- Why is the information being collected?
		- What is the intended use of the information?
		- With whom will the information be shared?
		- What notice will be provided to individuals?
		- How will the information be secured?
		- Is the information subject to the Privacy Act?
	- Requirements for PIA
		- When a PTA requires a PIA
		- Before developing or purchasing PII systems
		- Significant changes to PII systems
		- Every 3 years
The department of homeland security has a PIA template

Security Leader - serves as the subject matter expert on issues of confidentiality, integrity, and availability
Business Leader - understand the mission, goals, and objectives of the broader organization

Business Case
- Justify the investment of time and money
- Balance security and business concerns
- Achieve CIA goals

Security Governance
- Information governance committee
- Risk management committee
- Board of directors

Integrating Security Governance
- Ensure governing bodies understand risks and controls
- Inform governing bodies of security incidents
- Provide audit reports to governing bodies

Corporate Acquisitions
- Require integration of controls

Corporate Divestitures
- Require separation of controls

Security Roles and Responsibilities
- CISO - the most senior information security leader in an organization
- CISO leads a team of generalists and specialists

Due care - fulfilling legal responsibilities and professional best practices
Due diligence - take reasonable measures to investigate security risks
Defense in depth - multiple controls for one objective

Data classification policies
- Determines storage, handling, and access requirements
- Classifications are based on the sensitivity and criticality of information.
- Sensitivity: High, Medium, Low
- Criticality: Public, Private
- Classification guides security decisions
- Should include labeling requirements
- Securely dispose of information when no longer needed

Military Classification
Top Secret
Secret
Confidential
Unclassified

NDA - nondisclosure agreement; legally enforceable confidentiality obligations

Data sovereignty
- local laws apply to data storage
- data is only subject to laws of the jurisdictions where it is collected, stored, or processed
- storing data in multiple locations subjects it to multiple jurisdictions
- determine where cloud providers will store data
- put locations in writing
- encryption to protect data (requires key management processes)

De-identification: removing obvious identifiers (name, ssn, zip code, dob, gender)
Data Obfuscation: transforms PII into a form where it is no longer possible to tie it to an individual

Data minimization is the principle that data should only be processed and stored if it is necessary to perform the purpose for which it is collected. It affects the data retention policy.

Data Obfuscation methods:
- Hashing - replace sensitive fields with hash values
- Rainbow table attack - compare hash values with precomputed hashes
- Tokenization - sensitive values are replaced with a random identifier
- Masking - redact sensitive information from a file (add 'x' or asterisk)

DLP - Data loss prevention
- Technology solutions that search systems and monitor networks for sensitive information that is unsecured and provide the ability to remove the information, block the transmission, or encrypt the stored data
- Host-based dlp: software agents installed on a single system
- Network-based dlp: scans network transmissions for sensitive information
- Pattern matching: recognizes known patterns of sensitive information, such as SSNs.
- Watermarking: electronic tags are applied to files

Information Rights Managment
- Enforcing data rights
- Provisioning access
- Implementing access control models
- DRM - digital rights management
	- Provides the owners of intellectual property with the technical means to prevent the unauthorized use of their content through the use of encryption technology
	- DRM solutions can also restrict the distributing of unauthorized copies by authorizing specific hardware players.
- Business applications of DRM
	- Protect trade secrets and other intellectual property
	- Watermark sensitive documents
	- Limit redistribution of information
	- Revoke access after expiration date

Vendor Due-Diligence
- Vendor security policies must be at least as stringent as your own.

Vendor management lifecycle:
1. Vendor selection:
	1. formal RFP
	2. informal process
2. Onboarding:
	1. verify contract details
	2. arrange secure data transfer
	3. establish procedures
3. Monitoring
	1. site visits
	2. independent audits
	3. security incident results
4. Offboarding
	1. destroy confidential info
	2. unwind business relationship

Vendor agreements
- SLR: document specific requirements that a customer has about any aspect of a vendor's service performance
	- System response time
	- Service availability
	- Data preservation
- Document SLRs in a service-level agreement (SLA)
- SLA: conditions of service, and penalties for failing to meet those service levels

	3. require compliance from all employees
	4. approved at the highest levels of the organization
	5. policy statements must avoid being too specific

	2. derive their authority from policies
	3. follow a less rigorous approval process
	4. cis benchmarks
3. Guidelines
	1. provide advice to the org
	2. follow best practices
	3. compliance not mandatory
4. Procedures
	1. step-by-step process for an activity


## 5.2 Given a scenario, apply security concepts in support of organizational risk mitigation.

Risk Assessment
- Identify and prioritize risks
- Threat: external force jeopardizing systems
- Threat vector: the specific methods that threats use to exploit a vulnerability
- Vulnerability: weaknesses in security controls (misconfigurations)
- Risk: the combination of a vulnerability and a corresponding threat
- Prioritize risks by likelihood and impact.
- Likelihood: probability that a risk will occur.
- Impact: amount of expected damage

Techniques for risk assessment
- Qualitative: subjective ratings (low, medium, high)
- Quantitative: objective numeric ratings

Quantitative Risk Assessment
- Used for a single risk + asset pair
- AV - asset valuation
	- dollar value of the asset
	- Original cost
	- Depreciated cost
	- Replacement cost
- EF - exposure factor
	- expected percent of damage to an asset
- SLE - single loss expectancy
	- expected dollar loss if a risk occurs one time
	- `AV * EF = SLE
- ARO - annualized rate of occurrence
	- expected dollar loss if a risk occurs one time
- ALE - annualized loss expectancy
	- expected dollar loss from a risk in any given year
	- `SLE * ARO = ALE`
 
The time to restore service depends upon whether a component is repairable.
Non-repairable:
- MTTF - mean time to failure
	- average time a nonrepairable component will last
Repairable:
- MTBF - mean time between failures
	- average time gap between failures of a repairable component
- MTTR - mean time to repair
	- average time required to return a repairable component to service

Risk Management
- The process of systematically analyzing potential responses to each risk and implementing strategies to control those risks appropriately.

Risk Management Strategies
- Avoidance: change org's business practices
- Transference: shift the impact from one org to another (purchasing insurance)
- Mitigation: reduce the likelihood or impact
- Acceptance: accept the risk without taking further action

Risk profile: the full set of risks facing an organization

Risk register
- Document to track risk information
- Description
- Category
- Probability and impact
- Risk rating

Risk register sources
- risk assessments
- audit findings
- team member input
- threat intelligence


## 5.3 Explain the importance of frameworks, policies, procedures, and controls.

Risk Management Frameworks
- Prescriptive
	- Describes mandatory security requirements that must be implemented in all circumstances
- Risk-based
	- Allow organizations to adjust the level of control based upon the likelihood and impact of each risk

NIST Risk Management Framework
1. Categorize information systems
	1. Architectural descriptions
	2. Organization inputs

- Preventive - stop a security issue from occurring in the first place (such as a firewall)
- Detective - identify that a potential security issue has taken place (IDS)
- Responsive - implement incident response procedures (notification to police)
- Corrective - remediate issues that have already occured
Grouping controls by mechanism of action:
- Technical - use technology to achieve (firewall enforcing rules)
- Operational - human-driven processes to manage technology (training, access reviews, log monitoring, security guards)
- Managerial - improve the security of the risk managment process
