# Compliance and Assessment
---
## 5.1 Understand the importance of data privacy and protection.

PII
- Personally identifiable information
- Records that may be associated with a specific individual
- Credit reports, tax reports

PHI
- Protected health information
- Health records about an individual patient
- Regulated by HIPAA

GAPP - Generally Accepted Privacy Principles; 10 Components:
1. Management - Organizations handling private information should have policies, procedures, and governance structures in place to protect privacy
2. Notice - Data subjects should receive notice that their information is being collected and used, as well as access to the privacy policies and procedures followed by the organization.
3. Choice and Consent - The organization should inform data subjects of their options regarding the data they own and get consent from those individuals for the collection, storage, use, and sharing of that information.
4. Collection - The organization should only collect personal information for purposes disclosed in its privacy notices.
5. Use, retention, and disposal - organizations should only collect and use personal information for disclosed purposes, and they should dispose of the data securely as soon as it is no longer needed for the disclosed purpose.
6. Access - organizations should provide data subjects with the ability to review and update their personal information.
7. Disclosure to third parties - organizations should only share information with third parties if that sharing is consistent with the purposes disclosed in privacy notices, and they have the consent of the individual to share that information.
8. Security - the organization must secure private information against unauthorized access, either physically or logically.
9. Quality - the org should take reasonable steps to ensure that the private information it maintains is accurate, complete, and relevant.
10. Monitoring and enforcement - the organization should have a program in place to monitor compliance with its privacy policies and provide a dispute resolution mechanism.

Limiting data collection
- Notice and consent is the first level of restriction on data collection
- Never collect information outside of disclosures
- Minimize information collected
- Delete unneeded information quickly
- Legal teams should be consulted before data collection
- Verify 3rd party privacy practices

Privacy Assessments
- PTA
	- Privacy threshold analysis
	- Evaluates the use of personal information to determine whether privacy controls are necessary
- PIA
	- Privacy impact assessment
	- Evaluates the privacy controls used by an IT system to determine whether they are sufficient
	- Department of Homeland Security has a template
	- Three goals:
		1. Ensures that PII handling meets all applicable requirements
		2. Identifies risks associated with handling PII within an IT system
		3. Examines privacy controls and recommends mitigations
	- PIA Questions:
		- What information is being collected?
		- Why is the information being collected?
		- What is the intended use of the information?
		- With whom will the information be shared?
		- What notice will be provided to individuals?
		- How will the information be secured?
		- Is the information subject to the Privacy Act?
	- Requirements for PIA
		- When a PTA requires a PIA
		- Before developing or purchasing PII systems
		- Significant changes to PII systems
		- Every 3 years
The department of homeland security has a PIA template

Security Leader - serves as the subject matter expert on issues of confidentiality, integrity, and availability
Business Leader - understand the mission, goals, and objectives of the broader organization

Business Case
- Justify the investment of time and money
- Balance security and business concerns
- Achieve CIA goals

Security Governance
- Information governance committee
- Risk management committee
- Board of directors

Integrating Security Governance
- Ensure governing bodies understand risks and controls
- Inform governing bodies of security incidents
- Provide audit reports to governing bodies

Corporate Acquisitions
- Require integration of controls

Corporate Divestitures
- Require separation of controls

Security Roles and Responsibilities
- CISO - the most senior information security leader in an organization
- CISO leads a team of generalists and specialists

Due care - fulfilling legal responsibilities and professional best practices
Due diligence - take reasonable measures to investigate security risks
Defense in depth - multiple controls for one objective






## 5.2 Given a scenario, apply security concepts in support of organizational risk mitigation.




## 5.3 Explain the importance of frameworks, policies, procedures, and controls.

Privacy Compliance
- HIPAA - covers providers, insurers, information clearinghouses
- FERPA - covers student educational records
- GLBA - covers financial services
- COPPA - protects the privacy of children under the age of 13
- FISMA - federal organizations are required to adopt information assurance controls
- COSO - guidance on fraud, controls, finance, and ethics
- SOX - storage and retention of documents relating to an organization's financial and business operations.
- Privacy act of 1974 - Applies only to federal agencies
- GDPR - protects private data of EU residents
- PIPEDA - protects private data of citizens and businesses in Canada
- CPEA - Asia/Pacific agreement to protect privacy across international borders

Types of Security Controls
Grouping controls by purpose:
- Preventive - stop a security issue from occurring in the first place (such as a firewall)
- Detective - identify that a potential security issue has taken place (IDS)
- Responsive - implement incident response procedures (notification to police)
- Corrective - remediate issues that have already occured
Grouping controls by mechanism of action:
- Technical - use technology to achieve (firewall enforcing rules)
- Operational - human-driven processes to manage technology (training, access reviews, log monitoring, security guards)
- Managerial - improve the security of the risk managment process

Security controls 
- Procedures and mechanisms that an organization puts in place to manage security risks

Security Control Frameworks
- Guide security program design
- COBIT - used by auditors, link business goals with infosec
- ISO 27001 - part of a series of business standards
- NIST 800-53 - mandatory for federal agencies
- ITIL - IT service management (ITSM) framework; contains a security management component
- TOGAF - four architectural domains
- SABSA - uses a series of views

Types of Policies:
- Code of conduct - outlines user and administrator expectations
- Password policy - best practices for creating and maintaining passwords
- Acceptable use policy - describes how someone can use a service or resource
- Audit policy - tracks account log-on, management events, object access, and changes to system security and integrity

PCI DSS Prescriptive Framework:
- Tier 1 - organization has a reactive approach to security
- Tier 2 - organization prepares to mitigate cybersecurity risks by performing risk assessments
- Tier 3 - organization with defined policies and procedures driven by the IT department
- Tier 4 - organization that demonstrates management oversight of risks

NIST Cybersecurity Framework is risk-based and includes:
Framework core
1. Identify: risk assessment, asset management, governance, business environment, and risk management strategy
2. Protect: information processes and procedures, access control, awareness and training, data security, maintenance, and protective technology.
3. Detect: anomolies and events, security continuous monitoring, detection processes.
4. Respond: response planning, communications, analysis, mitigation, improvements
5. Recover: recovery planning, improvements, communications
