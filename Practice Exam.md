1. Obtaining which of the following can reduce the likelihood of purchasing counterfeit equipment? A: OEM Documentation
2. A SQL server's usage is increasing usage, what can you use to determine when to take action? A: Trend analysis. E: Trend analysis focuses on the long term direction in the increase or decrease in a particular type of traffic.
3. Which of the following is NOT considered to be a stakeholder to the incident response process? A: Sales
4. Which of the following is a system that has been isolated from other systems and is used for analyzing suspect files and messages for malware? A: Sheep dip computer
5. The team has isolated a piece of unusual software and is attempting to use a decompiler on it. What operations are they performing? A: Decomposition
6. Which of the following is NOT a role of the legal department in the creation of an incident response plan? A: Create policies and procedures that support the removal of employees found to be engaging in improper or illegal activity. (HR department is responsible for this.)
7. Analyze the output of an nmap scan and determine the true statement. A: There are 993 ports shown as filtered, which means they were blocked at the firewall. Therefore, we cannot tell if they are open or not on the host.
8. Which of the following is NOT a consideration when determining the value of a digital asset? A: Age of the asset
9. During this comparison, you notice that there are several vulnerabilities in all the reports that you know are false positives. What should you do? A: Add a note to the latest report that the identified vulnerabilities are false positives.
10. A vendor is describing an access control system in which users do not control access to resources. What type of system is this? A: MAC
11. Which of the following factors is LEAST likely to affect vulnerability scanning schedules? A: SLAs
12. Which of the following is used to sanitize a SSD? A: special commands (shredding renders the drive unusable)
13. CVSS2# AV:A/AC:H/Au:M/C:N/I:C/A:N. A: Exploiting this vulnerability would result in total compromise of system integrity (The 'I' metric has a value of 'C' which means complete.)
14. CVSS2# AV:L... A: Attack vector L means local. The attacker must have physical or logical access on the local system.
15. What should you submit to start the change control process? A: RFC (request for change).
16. What CVSS vector should you check to determine what type of access the attacker will need to the affected system for the vulnerability to occur? A: AV
17. Which of the following is NOT considered as part of the scope of each attack? A: The type of data that could be at risk. Scope of attack is gauged by: downtime, recovery time, data integrity, economic, system process criticality
18. Which of the following forms does not have to be in the forensics kit? A: forensic equipment list.
19. Which of the following would be a compensating control? A: Provide special training to the users. (Training users does not eliminate the vulnerability, it only makes it less likely. This defines a compensating control.)
20. In what order are the lines of an access list read when applied to a router interface?
	1. Top to bottom if it is an extended access list.
	2. Top to bottom if it is a standard access list.
	3. Specific, frequently occuring conditions should be at the top.
21. Identify the correct scanning parameters for the servers.
	1. Sensitivity level - Assessment scan
	2. Scope - 10.1.1.2 through 10.1.1.10
	3. Authentication - Credentialed
22. You need to use standardized names so that a security analyst contractor can understand the report. Which SCAP component should you use? A: CVE (Provides standardized names for security-related software flaws.)
24. This entity creates benchmarks for the PCI-DSS compliance program as well as others. What organization is this? A: CIS (Center for Internet security funded by SANS)
26. What type of web vulnerability scanning captures and analyzes every transaction of the user? A: RUM, real user monitoring; a type of passive monitoring
27. Which statements are TRUE of IPSec?
	1. IPSec uses encapsulation security payload (ESP) and authentication headers (AH) as security protocols for encapsulation.
	2. IPSec can work in either tunnel mode or transport mode.
	3. The IPSec framework is used in a VPN implementation to secure transmissions.
28. Which of the following is a forensic suite tool? A: FTK
